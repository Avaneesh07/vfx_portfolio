\# Day 6 – Level Geometry (Ramps \& Platforms)

\- Added static line-segment geometry (ramp, platform, funnel, ledge).

\- Circle–segment collision with positional correction + normal/tangent velocity update.

\- Controls: L (cycle level), H (toggle geometry). Trails and mass-aware ball–ball collisions retained.
